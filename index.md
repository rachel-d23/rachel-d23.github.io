#Hello World! 

My name is Rachel, and I am glad you found my space of the web :)

Here I am sharing my journey to being a software developer, and how I am rediscovering my passion for coding and building solutions with technology. 

I am happy to take you along my journey, and I hope to teach you what I have learned! I will also share my reflections as I explore my interests in the tech industry. 

Thank you!

Rachel
